class Blacklist
  # The filter function takes two arguments - the data you want to filter and a
  # blacklist map of the keys you want removed.  It is called recursively for
  # each level of data that is to be filtered.
  #
  #  * Key has either a Boolean value or a Hash as content
  #    * Key == "xxx"
  #      * The key is a string pattern to match on, as per knife search
  #      * Wildcards are:
  #        * '*' for 0 or more characters
  #        * '?' for a single character
  #    * Boolean == true
  #      * Prune entire subtree *INCLUSIVE* of this key
  #    * Boolean == false
  #      * Prune entire subtree *EXCLUSIVE* of this key
  #    * Hash == {}
  #      * Descend to next level and don't prune this key
  #
